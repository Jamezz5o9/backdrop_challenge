WHY IS PURE LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE ALGORITHM MORE EFFECTIVE
THAN THE BROADER DAMERAU LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE ALGORITHM
        
```agsl   
    The more specialized Damerau-Levenshtein Distance technique may be preferable 
    than the more general Levenshtein Distance method in circumstances when 
    transpositions of nearby characters are unlikely to occur. This is due to the 
    fact that the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm takes transpositions into account, 
    which makes the computations for the algorithm more challenging. 
    In the unique situation of validating names, transpositions of nearby characters are 
    unlikely to happen, hence a pure Levenshtein Distance method might be a more efficient 
    and cost-efficient strategy. However, in circumstances when transpositions are common, 
    the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance method would be more appropriate.propriate.
